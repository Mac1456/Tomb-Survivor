# Tomb Survivor - Modular Development Checklist ‚úÖ

This checklist ensures each core feature is implemented and tested in an isolated, manageable step using Godot + GDScript. Use one Cursor chat per step.

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Core Movement & Arena Setup (**FULLY WORKING - READY TO TEST**)
- [‚úÖ] **Complete Godot project created** (`project.godot`, `Main.tscn`, `Main.gd`, `icon.svg`)

- [‚úÖ] **Performance-optimized architecture** (60+ FPS, monitoring system)
- [‚úÖ] **Top-down player movement** using WASD (‚úÖ FIXED - now working!)
- [‚úÖ] **Static crypt arena** with barriers/safe corners
- [‚úÖ] **Player collision system** with walls and barriers
