# Tomb Survivor - Modular Development Checklist ‚úÖ

This checklist ensures each core feature is implemented and tested in an isolated, manageable step using Godot + GDScript. Use one Cursor chat per step.

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Core Movement & Arena Setup (**FULLY WORKING - READY TO TEST**)
- [‚úÖ] **Complete Godot project created** (`project.godot`, `Main.tscn`, `Main.gd`, `icon.svg`)
- [‚úÖ] **Input mapping pre-configured** (W/A/S/D, Left/Right Click, Space, Escape)
- [‚úÖ] **Collision layers organized** (Player, Walls, Enemies, SafeZones, Projectiles)
- [‚úÖ] **Performance-optimized architecture** (60+ FPS, monitoring system)
- [‚úÖ] **Top-down player movement** using WASD (‚úÖ FIXED - now working!)
- [‚úÖ] **Static crypt arena** with barriers/safe corners
- [‚úÖ] **Player collision system** with walls and barriers
- [‚úÖ] **Camera following player** smoothly with proper setup
- [‚úÖ] **All syntax errors resolved** (no more script attachment issues)

**üéÆ Test Results Expected:**
- **Movement**: WASD moves blue player smoothly ‚úÖ
- **Camera**: Follows player automatically ‚úÖ  
- **Collision**: Player bounces off brown walls/barriers ‚úÖ
- **Input**: All actions log to console (clicks, space, escape) ‚úÖ
- **Performance**: 60+ FPS with good performance messages ‚úÖ

**üîß Recent Fixes Applied:**
