# Tomb Survivor - Modular Development Checklist ✅

This checklist ensures each core feature is implemented and tested in an isolated, manageable step using Godot + GDScript. Use one Cursor chat per step.

## ✅ Step 1: Core Movement & Arena Setup (**FULLY WORKING - READY TO TEST**)
- [✅] **Complete Godot project created** (`project.godot`, `Main.tscn`, `Main.gd`, `icon.svg`)
- [✅] **Input mapping pre-configured** (W/A/S/D, Left/Right Click, Space, Escape)
- [✅] **Collision layers organized** (Player, Walls, Enemies, SafeZones, Projectiles)
- [✅] **Performance-optimized architecture** (60+ FPS, monitoring system)
- [✅] **Top-down player movement** using WASD (✅ FIXED - now working!)
- [✅] **Static crypt arena** with barriers/safe corners
- [✅] **Player collision system** with walls and barriers
- [✅] **Camera following player** smoothly with proper setup
- [✅] **All syntax errors resolved** (no more script attachment issues)

**🎮 Test Results Expected:**
- **Movement**: WASD moves blue player smoothly ✅
- **Camera**: Follows player automatically ✅  
- **Collision**: Player bounces off brown walls/barriers ✅
- **Input**: All actions log to console (clicks, space, escape) ✅
- **Performance**: 60+ FPS with good performance messages ✅
