# Tomb Survivor

A top-down 2D multiplayer survival arena game built with Godot and GDScript as part of a Game Week project challenge.

## Project Overview

**Tomb Survivor** is a real-time, arcade-style dungeon survival game for 1-4 players. Set in a single, large crypt room, players must survive increasingly difficult enemy rounds using 8 unique rogue characters with distinct abilities and stats.

## Game Features

### Core Gameplay
- **8 Rogue Characters** with unique stats (Strength, Speed, Armor, Health) and abilities
- **Round-Based Survival** with auto-progression and escalating difficulty
- **1-4 Player Co-op** using Godot's multiplayer API
- **Character Progression** through XP, leveling, and powerups
- **Boss Fights** every 10 rounds featuring Witch Bosses

### Controls
- **Move**: WASD
- **Aim**: Mouse direction
- **Attack**: Left Click (Primary attack)
- **Special**: Right Click (Special ability)
- **Ultimate**: Spacebar (Unlocked at higher levels)

### Technical Requirements
- **Platform**: Desktop (PC)
- **Engine**: Godot 4.x
- **Language**: GDScript
- **Performance**: Low latency, 1-4 concurrent players
- **Architecture**: Performance-optimized single-file structure

## Performance Optimization

This project follows performance-first development principles:

### ✅ Performance Features
- **Entity Limit**: Max 50 entities to prevent overload
- **StaticBody2D**: Used for all walls (no RigidBody2D)
- **Minimal Collision**: Only essential colliders
- **Optimized Scripts**: No heavy per-frame operations
- **FPS Monitoring**: Performance warnings if FPS drops below 45
- **Efficient Rendering**: Simple ColorRect visuals
- **Smart Camera**: Attached to player for automatic following

### ⚠️ Performance Considerations
- Arena size limited to 1200x800 for optimal performance
- Collision layers properly configured for efficiency
- Physics bodies minimized and optimized
- Event-driven logic instead of constant polling
- Viewport culling ready for future entity management

## Development Approach

This project follows a **modular development methodology** using AI-augmented learning to rapidly master unfamiliar technologies. Each feature is implemented and tested in isolation before integration.

### Development Steps
1. ✅ **Core Movement & Arena Setup** - Performance-optimized foundation
2. ⬜ Core Combat Mechanics
3. ⬜ Character System & Selection
4. ⬜ Enemy System
5. ⬜ Round System
6. ⬜ XP and Leveling
7. ⬜ Boss Logic
8. ⬜ Powerups and Drops
9. ⬜ Inter-Round Features
10. ⬜ Real-Time Multiplayer
11. ⬜ Background Music and Audio Polish
